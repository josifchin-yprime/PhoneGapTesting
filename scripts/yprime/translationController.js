Pain can be described as unpleasant and also can have different time qualities.\n\nThe Pain Quality Assessment Scale helps us measure these and other different aspects of your pain. For one patient, a pain might feel extremely hot and burning, but not at all dull, while another patient may not experience any burning pain, but feel like their pain is very dull and achy. Therefore, we expect you to rate very high on some of the scales and very low on others. \n\nPlease use the 19 rating sclaes to rate how much of each different pain quality and type you may or may not have felt OVER THE PAST WEEK, ON AVERAGE.
